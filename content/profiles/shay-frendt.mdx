🧱 I am a builder at heart and love to strategize.

🖥️ Currently building a better way to build software at @glideapps.

🐼🚀 Previously: GitHub ← Ranger ← Chargify ← Relevance ← CGI ← J House Media

Excited to nerd out on all things distributed systems. Also more than happy to rabbithole on aviation, motorcycles, farming, camping, or any build project.
