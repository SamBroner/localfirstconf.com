Hey, I discovered CRDTs while watching Martin Kleppmann's lecture series on distributed systems in 2022 and spent ~9 months researching & prototyping CRDTs for my third-year technical project.
I had my last CS exam on Wednesday, so I'm free to explore the local-first space further!
I often use [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to create mobile apps but the local-first ecosystem for Flutter is underwhelming, something I wish to change :)
